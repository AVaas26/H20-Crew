    <h2 class="h2" id="section1">The Water Project</h2>
    <p id="information1">The main intention of The water Project to people is to make sure that people get the pure and healthy drinking water 
        specially in the areas with low supply or crisis. Water is crucial for human life and, yet, some communities 
        all over the world don’t have sufficient access to this basic thing because of various reasons like poverty, environment damage, 
        or loss of infrastructure. To meet this urgent demand, donors aim to mitigate the short-run suffering, protect from diseases 
        that are easily transmitted through water and to help communities which need support, whether because of natural disasters, 
        conflicts or due to chronic economic issues. As well as that, those initiatives commonly strive to develop durable options for 
        water use and facilities, with a purpose of establishing permanent positive effects on the nice of life, health as well as well-being 
        of these communities’ members.

    <p id="information2">To us, community outreach involves accountability and transparency to all people among our donors, our communities and our teams
        And that is why we are crazy about carrying the great reports received from the field. It looks like being invited to join in 
        our everyday jobs and merriment. With us you will not mobilize just a few resources but empower people who are here at out 
        headquarters as well as our partners in the field. Each donation has its own original community.
        Each present stands for an untold story, a person or a future.Every gift has impact.
        We take the monitoring of all our projects, old and new, to make sure that they still function as they had intended, seriously, 
        so that the impact is long term. And we fix everything that is broken. We think, even the water dropping today should be falling in 
        the future as well. To test our projects and understand them deeper you can check out our Projects Directory.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Clean water boosts education. It prevents them from being ill, therefore seldom missing classes. They keep being hydrated to 
                concentrate more in their lesson. Time that would have been used obtaining water is now dedicated to studying.
                When there is clean water for hand washing, disease transmission in schools is reduced. All in all, clean water helps to create 
                a better and safe community that the students can prosper in.

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>Availability of safe water has confidence saving lives. Infected water is a tool for, disease transmission such as 
                diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery. Besides many other illness which one can suffer in the case there is no clean drinking 
                water available, the sole risk of drinking clean water is that eventually it would put an end to the risk of diseases and would 
                lead to a high level of immunity. Tanzania stands to enjoy potable water that is a factor of healthy body functioning. 
                This is important as it enhances wellness and health in individuals.

        <div class="benefits">
            <img src="img/Time.png" alt="Time">
            <h2>Time</h2>
            <p>Absolutely! Apart from the sole utility of temporary water supply, it lessen the time spent in gathering water from the areas 
                that lack availability to clean supply of water. Even walking, once in a while, instead of driving helps in the economization 
                of the time needed to withdraw and clean the water closer to home.
                Waterborne diseases are the top reason for recurring sickness episodes, 
                causing resigned people to skip work or school. Swallowing clean water on the part of most of the population doesn't 
                just mean less diseases but also more hours for production.

            <h2>Poverty</h2>
            <p>The access to safe water remained the weapon for poverty reduction. It provides diligent employees with a good health. 
                So, they can stay with the company. Time saved as people march for clean water access is a time spent working in jobs or school.
                 Providing pure irrigation and having safe and healthy crops will contribute either for individuals to eat or to sell and earn 
                 cash from crop production. After all, if the water is clean then there is less sickness and more being done. 
                 This makes the lives of the people better and allows them to get above the vicious circle of poverty.

        <p>Through The Water Project’s Wash program, abundant water percolating from the two seasonal rains that flow through a 
            myriad of springs with high water tables and deep aquifers in the Western Kenya area will be accessed, protected, filtered, 
            and disinfected to meet the needs of residents. Evaluate water programs in villages, schools, and places of worship in Western Kenya 
            such protected springs, rain water catchment systems, and water wells. 
            The concept of the program lies in the principle of equal geographic propagation of the activities, 
            qualitative training in hygiene and sanitation, and the contacts among health workers, local officials and educators.

             Investigate activities undertaken in this region to ascertain how you can avail yourself of (being an active team member in)
